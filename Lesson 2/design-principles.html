    <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
    <h3>Home River Group</h3>

    <p>This website follows the rule of thirds because the main information you need is in the middle of the screen when you go to the website. Since this is a realty website they want you to look at houses, and that option is right there in the middle of the page.</p>

    <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
    <h3>ChurchofJesusChrist.org</h3>

    <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a>
    <p>I liked the church's website for white space because I thought there was a good amount of white space when you are browsing the site. They have a good amount at the top of their website and also between pictures and links there is a litle section of white.</p>
    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <h3>On the Grid</h3>
    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/06e5fabc-d379-4eb7-b6b5-7ee597a4df24%2Fon%20the%20grid%20city.PNG?v=1601148303035" alt="On the Grid's homepage"><br>
    <a href="https://onthegrid.city/">Onthegrid.city</a>
    <p>This website has cool contrast because of the bright colors of each city. The whole page is filled with different colors. The two main colors of the page are blue and yellow which contrast very nicely. I think this website does a good job with contrast.</p>
