    <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
    <h3>Home River Group</h3>

    <p>This website follows the rule of thirds because the main information you need is in the middle of the screen when you go to the website. Since this is a realty website they want you to look at houses, and that option is right there in the middle of the page.</p>

    <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
    <h3>ChurchofJesusChrist.org</h3>

    <p>I liked the church's website for white space because I thought there was a good amount of white space when you are browsing the site. They have a good amount at the top of their website and also between pictures and links there is a litle section of white.</p>
    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <h3>Quiksilver</h3>

    <p>Contrast can take a boring photo and turn it into something interesting. On this Quiksilver page, we see a girl who is wearing a teal sweatshirt with a small emblem of a rainbow and peace sign. And then behind her are muted versions of the colors on her sweatshirt. This provide contrast because at first your eyes are drawn to the emblem and then soon after you look at the contrast of colors behind her. It becomes a very dynamic and impactful photo. Especially with the white that surrounds the photo.</p>
