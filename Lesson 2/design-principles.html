    <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
    <h3>Home River Group</h3>

    <p>This website follows the rule of thirds because the main information you need is in the middle of the screen when you go to the website. Since this is a realty website they want you to look at houses, and that option is right there in the middle of the page.</p>

    <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
    <h3>Purple</h3>

    <p>Purple is a good example of white space and clean design. In this picture, you can see that there are mainly two colors, white and purple. This presents a very clean design as you are able to take in the information as a consumer without distractions or the feeling of being cluttered. They also keep everything very clear and easy to read. The white space is also very important so that the audience can feel like they can breathe. I feel like Purple does a very good job with this.</p>

    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <h3>Quiksilver</h3>

    <p>Contrast can take a boring photo and turn it into something interesting. On this Quiksilver page, we see a girl who is wearing a teal sweatshirt with a small emblem of a rainbow and peace sign. And then behind her are muted versions of the colors on her sweatshirt. This provide contrast because at first your eyes are drawn to the emblem and then soon after you look at the contrast of colors behind her. It becomes a very dynamic and impactful photo. Especially with the white that surrounds the photo.</p>
